Strategic Energy Analysis: Sweden (2023-2025)
📊 Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption across Sweden’s three primary economic hubs: Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö. By leveraging both Power BI for business intelligence and Tableau for geographic visualization, the project identifies consumption patterns, urban efficiency trends, and regional energy loads from 2023 to 2025.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
Power BI: Developed interactive bar charts with multi-select slicers to compare city-specific growth and total GWh metrics.

Tableau Public: Engineered a geographic bubble map with dual-axis sizing to visualize spatial distribution and energy density.

Excel: Data engineering, including cleaning, formatting, and geographic role preparation.

💡 Key Business Insights
Stockholm Leadership: Stockholm remains the highest overall consumer, peaking in 2024, representing the core energy load of the region.

The Malmö Efficiency Trend: Analysis shows a steady decrease in energy consumption for Malmö across the 3-year period, suggesting successful local efficiency initiatives or residential shifts.

Spatial Concentration: Using Tableau's geographic heat mapping, a clear concentration of energy demand is visible in the southern urban corridor, highlighting critical infrastructure points.
